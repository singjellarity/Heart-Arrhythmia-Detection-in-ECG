# Design of Heart Arrhythmia Detection in ECG Beats Utilizing Machine Learning Algorithm with Signal Processing

Based on the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/), this repository contains some of my team's codes used for our final design project required for our bachelor's program in Electronics Engineering.

## Partial Abstract
```
In this paper, the proposed method uses a machine learning model that can classify ECG beats 
generated from the human heart to 5 types: normal beat, supraventricular premature beat, premature 
ventricular contraction, fusion of ventricular and normal beat, and unclassified beat. In consideration of other 
studies, the proponents designed a wearable heath care device for heart arrhythmia detection in ECG beats 
utilizing machine learning algorithm with signal processing. The system in form of wearable health device 
comes with built-in storage subsystem and cloud-based data visualization. It also features sensing and 
recording of heart rate, BP, and body temperature as a supplementary feature of the device. Furthermore, 
the paper is not suggesting any self-diagnosis based on the classified beats. It simply aims to simplify the 
ECG signal to beats to reduce the time cardiologists need to read the ECG recordings.
